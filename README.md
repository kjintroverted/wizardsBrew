# Wizard's Brew

A server to handle data for managing a D&D party. 

## Data

The project includes raw json data that acts as the source for much of the base SRD data. The data is then converted into SQL inserts and entered into a PSQL database.

## Development

### Setup

To setup the DB run `go run . sql`

### Startup

To start the server run `go run .`

If you are trying to connect to an external front end you need to set up CORS like 

```
ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 go run .
```

## API

The api interacts with the PSQL database and serves the data out to the requester.

### Endpoints

Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents.

Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.",

          "For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."

Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?",

Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?",
